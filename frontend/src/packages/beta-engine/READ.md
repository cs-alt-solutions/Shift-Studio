# BETA ENGINE: The "Alphabet" Community Ecosystem

## VISIONARY BRIEF
This package was architected by Alternative Solutions. It is a fully encapsulated, framework-agnostic community feedback loop. It is designed to shift users from "customers" to "Co-Creators" by providing an interactive, gamified feedback experience via the "GlitchBot" and the "Beta Hub."

**Core Philosophy:** Perspective is power. A single perspective cannot build the most efficient app. This engine captures the missing half of the machine.

## 1. MANDATORY PACKAGE RULES (THE LAW)
To maintain the integrity and portability of this package, the following rules are absolute:

1. **Total Isolation:** This package MUST NOT import anything from outside its own folder (e.g., do not import from `src/utils/glossary.js`). It must survive completely on its own.
2. **Single Source of Truth:** Absolutely NO hardcoded text in the JSX. Every single string, label, and prompt must live in `src/packages/beta-engine/dictionary.js`.
3. **No Inline Styles:** All styling is strictly handled by `GlitchBot.css` and `BetaHub.css`. 
4. **Context Awareness:** The GlitchBot must always be fed the `currentContext` prop so it knows exactly what the user is looking at.
5. **Component Structure:** The Beta Hub must remain a modular shell, with tab contents separated into the `tabs/` directory.
